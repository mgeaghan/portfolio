Hi! I'm Michael. I am a trained scientist turned data analyst.
I studied biotechnology at the University of Newcastle, Australia, and continued on to earn a PhD in medical biochemistry. It was during my PhD that I developed an interest in bioinformatics and large-scale data analysis and data science.
