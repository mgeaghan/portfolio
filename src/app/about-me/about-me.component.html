		<p>Hi! I'm Michael. I am a trained scientist-turned-data-analyst.</p>
		<p>
			I studied biotechnology at the University of Newcastle, Australia, and continued on to earn a PhD in medical biochemistry.
			It was during my PhD that I developed an interest in bioinformatics and large-scale data analysis and data science.
